Alter File Names
Create a Python script that meets the following requirements:
1. Script Name is exactly: /usr/local/bin/case_change.py
2. The script should accept the command line option -c with possible values of upper or lower (for example: case_change.py -c upper).
3. When the value passed to the -c option is upper, the script should change all filenames in the directory /var/data/afh/ to upper case.
4. When the value passed to the -c option is lower, the script should change all filenames in the directory /var/data/afh/ to lower case.

For example, a filename of TestFile123 would change to either TESTFILE123 or testfile123 depending on the value passed to the -c option.
